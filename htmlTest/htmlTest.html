    <h2>Best way to learn anything</h2>

      <h3>Learn By Doing</h3>
      <p>Immersion is by far the best way to learn anything. And as research shows, it turns out that humans retain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5% of what they learn when they’ve learned from a lecture.</li>
        <li>10% of what they learn when they’ve learned from reading.</li>
        <li>20% of what they learn from audio-visual.</li>
        <li>30% of what they learn when they see a demonstration</li>
        <li>50% of what they learn when engaged in a group discussion.</li>
        <li>75% of what they learn when they practice what they learned.</li>
        <li>90% of what they learn when they use it immediately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think back to how you learned to play basketball, ride a bicycle, or swim. Instead of watching tutorial videos or reading a textbook on how to do something, the way to learn faster is to get into the trenches and gain experience through making mistakes.</p>

    <h2>HTML Forms</h2>
    <h3>What is HTML Form</h3>
    <p>HTML Forms are required to collect different kinds of user inputs, such as contact details like name, email address, phone numbers, or details like credit card information, etc.</p>
    <p>Forms contain special elements called controls like inputbox, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, etc. Users generally complete a form by modifying its controls e.g. entering text, selecting items, etc. and submitting this form to a web server for further processing.</p>
    <p>The "form" tag is used to create an HTML form. Here's a simple example of a login form:</p>
    <form>
      <label>Username: <input type="text" placeholder="username"></label>
      <label>Password: <input type="password" placeholder="password"></label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
